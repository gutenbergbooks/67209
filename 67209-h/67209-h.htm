<span class="firstchar">A</span> piano, alone on a stage; shadowed light around and above it; ivory
and ebony moving out of the shadow; and the silence that hangs
there before the musician plays. There is nothing like it in the world,—nothing
more wonderful....

<p class="noindent">
There are “revolutions” going on in all the arts. The revolution in
poetry is coming in for a lot of discussion, so that even the layman is conscious
of it. His feeling about it is that some effeminate beings called
Imagists are trying to emasculate the noble art of poetry. But the thing
is happening right under his nose and he is careful to keep posted, in order
to be able to defend his favorite theory. As for the stage, he knows that
Gordon Craig and Rhinehart have been using screens instead of marble
pillars painted against red velvet curtains. In painting he knows all about
the cubists and futurists; he even knows that the donkey’s tail story was
something of a joke. In sculpture he has heard of an unreasonable reaction
from Rodin, and he has probably seen Brzeska’s head of Ezra Pound. In
the ballet he has a rather clear idea of why the old classical form wouldn’t
serve; perhaps because the Russians have demonstrated so clearly what
it was they could do with the new form. In opera he thinks very little is
happening. He is right.
</p>

<p>
But the slowest revolution of all—and the most interesting—is that
which is just beginning in the art of the piano. It is the slowest because
it is not the public alone that is bound to the old form. The masters themselves
have not visioned toward a need that would make a new form inevitable.
The need is—a deeper music. And it is the most interesting because
the convention that has bound the piano,—virtuosity,—is a more worthy
convention than that which has restricted any of the other arts.
</p>

<p>
There is a universe of the arts in the piano. But it is not a universe
now. It is a stunt. The piano has been used for stunts for years and
years and years. It will go on being used that way for years. Well, I am
the last one to deprecate the art of these stunts. I think they are beautiful—some
of them. I think they have their place. But they have served it
too well. I love them more than I love all the opals and rubies and sapphires
and emeralds and topaz and amethyst and pearl a jeweller can dip his fingers
into and spread out for your dazzled senses. But I love poetry more than
jewels. And I love music more than poetry. In the music of the piano you
get the best illustration that music is a thing beginning and ending in itself,
a thing not of story or image but of sound, a thing that must be understood
quite simply in its own terms,—as Hiram Kelly Moderwell puts it, a thing
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
that must be heard and not seen. And in the revolution that is beginning
you get this first pure principle combined with another; that the music of
the piano must reach to the passion of life. This is quite different from
saying that music must be a dramatization of human life. It is merely saying
that ballet dancing could never have produced an Isadora Duncan.
</p>

<p>
I imagine that Harold Bauer must have said something of this sort to
himself. He has certainly said it on the piano. His attitude toward the
piano has this sort of prophecy in it. It is a matter of the beauty of sound.
The methods of approach of all the “masters” have been the same. They
have imposed something upon the piano. But Bauer has approached the
handling of the piano as Debussy approached composition—or Schönberg.
</p>

<p>
When Schönberg wrote that “the alleged tones believed to be foreign
to harmony do not exist; they are merely tones foreign to our accepted
harmonic system”, and that “tonality is not a hard and fast compulsion
directing the course of music but a concept which makes it possible for us
to give our ideas the requisite aspect of compactness”, he was saying practically
what Bauer has suggested about the touching of the piano: that
virtuosity is only a means to an end, that the springs of the art have been
drying up, and that until the musician can <em>hear</em> better he is not worthy of
the sounds the piano has to give him. You can’t play César Franck with the
same hands you use for Liszt. You must change your hands into different
“feelers”. The piano will give you the quality of almost every instrument.
It is as though Bauer had said: “They call this an instrument of percussion.
They have laid down its limitation. But I doubt very much whether it will
stay within that limitation. I suspect it does not stop there but goes on
into a realm where sound is of infinite development.” That is why you
hear an organ when he plays César Franck; that is why you realize how
the Imagists have worked when he plays Debussy; that is why you
get a sense of painting in all his music. Bauer puts on the sound like paint.
He knows, as Romain Rolland has said, that every art tends to become a
universe in itself; that music becomes painting and poetry, that painting
becomes music, etc. And Bauer is not a genius. He has merely suggested
what will happen to the piano, and paved the way for an openness of mind
about it. He has made a good many people gossip of how his scales won’t
compare with those of the other great ones; but he has made a good many
more suspect that there has been something lacking in the ultimatums of
the piano athletes. He has done many simple and dynamic things to bring
the piano into its own.
</p>

<p>
But the full achievement of this will go beyond what has been heard
yet anywhere; and the man who does it will be scorned as the greatest fool
or madman of his time before it is fully understood. It doesn’t matter.
The thing will happen—I hardly know how. I hardly even know words
with which to tell what it will be like. It can only be told on the piano.
</p>

<p>
In his <em>Spiritual Adventures</em> Arthur Symons has a story of a musician
who says more true things about the piano than I have ever found anywhere
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
else. One of them is this: “Most modern music is a beggar for
pity. The musician tries to show us how he has suffered and how hopeless
he is. He sets his toothache and his heartache to music, putting those sufferings
into the music without remembering that sounds have their own
agonies which alone they can express in a perfect manner.” This is where
the “lions and panthers of the piano” have failed most: they have not
loved the sounds enough. They have not allowed each sound its full life.
This is the real reason why the piano has stopped short of itself. They
might almost as well have played bells. You can strike bells which will
bring out any number of tunes, loud or soft, with every possible variety
of phrasing. <em>But your interest will be in the tune rather than in the sound.</em>
You can’t limit the piano to the tunes that can be played upon it. You
don’t treat a violin that way, nor an organ. And of course you can register
a piano almost as fully as an organ with the “stops” that are in the ends
of your fingers. How fascinating it is, and how wonderful!
</p>

<p>
But most piano recitals are like recitations—or some sort of performance
on a school platform. Their beauty ends with the beauty of style, phrasing,
finish, tone, taste. It is diction rather than music. It is science.
Busoni is not a prophet; he is an orchestra. Hofmann loves style more
than he does sound. Godowsky loves patterns more than sound. Gabrilowitsch
loves delicate sounds intensely, but has no feeling for the sounds of
great chords. Zeisler loves rhythm more than sound. And so on. Paderewski
loves the piano. He is genius, pure and simple—though of course
there is nothing less pure or simple. He may do what he likes—break sounds
into bits, crack them like nuts. It doesn’t matter. He never fails to communicate
a mood to the instrument—the mood of his personal equation. And
that is art. “Przybyszewski playing Chopin”—that would also be art.
What have the excellent piano concerts you hear to do with art, with inspiration?
Piano playing is certainly something to be surpassed. Music is the
thing! And that means ecstasy, madness, divinity,—the beauty upon which
all the ends of the world are come. The design of sound.... Each
sound that comes out of the piano is something alive....
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
And now for the interesting part.
</p>

<p>
When I talk of the “new music”—which will be different from Debussy
and Schönberg and all the rest of them—I am not talking of how far beyond
the limits of known harmony, or the anarchy which disregards any harmonic
system, we shall go. Undoubtedly, as far as all that is concerned,
“some day some one will dig down to the roots and turn up music as it is
before it is tamed to the scale.” This seems to me a settled fact. But I
am much more interested in the piano itself and the deliverer who is to set
it free from the lie which has grown up around it and make it vibrate to a
truer color. It is all in the plane of vibration, I believe. It will come about
in three ways: through the mechanical development of the piano, through
a new type of music, and chiefly through the new type of pianist.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
You will have your Mason and Hamlin—(this is not advertising; it
is merely a conviction)—you will have that great dark-winged-victory standing
alone on a stage; you will care a great deal about the color of the light
around and above it—the tones of the walls within which your beautiful
sounds are to live; you will touch that ivory and ebony—oh, there are no
words! You will <em>see</em> those sounds against the color....
</p>

<p>
You may write a program for your audience—something like this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

I believe the right technical approach is simply a different<a id="missing"></a>
are the most beautiful there are anywhere in the world—more
beautiful than the wind in trees or the moan in the sea or the
silence that is heard on deserts;
</p>

<p>
I believe that these sounds live only by a certain magic of
invocation. There are no rules for them—unless perhaps you
want to read Bergson.
</p>

<p>
I believe the right technical approach is simply a different
kind of friendship—or love affair—with each sound.
</p>

<p>
I believe that tone goes way beyond the range between pianissimo
and fortissimo, between legato and staccato, etc. Tone
is radiance, eagerness, light, darkness, devastation, something
that melts, something that cries and burns, something that shatters.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe in playing “programs”—ending with a
blaze of Liszt. I couldn’t play the <em>Campanella</em> to save my life,
but I don’t see that it matters.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe in “program” music—beginning with Bach
(now that the public has learned to applaud him) and ending
with Liszt. I couldn’t play the <em>Campenella</em> to save my life, but
I don’t see that it matters.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe in nature music—babbling brooks and
warbling birds. I believe in nature mood, just as I do in the
mood of all great phenomena.
</p>

<p>
The music I have made will be sometimes merely the curve
of a mood—like the curve of line in Watts’s <em>Orpheus and Eurydice</em>;
or merely the design of a color or a scent. But always it
will keep close to two fundamentals: that “hard gemlike flame”
and the rhythm of sex.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
All this will come under the classification of those things which are
so worth knowing that they can never be taught. It will belong to that
individual who can say the new word—his own word. It will make the
piano something we have scarcely dreamed of. It will make up an art that
has nothing to do with the four walls of a room. It could not be set to
“Questions and Answers” in <em>The Ladies’ Home Journal</em>. It will have little
to do with accomplishment, but everything to do with that which is of all
things the highest manifestation of life.

<p>
I have been sybariticizing with thirteen beautiful little volumes of
Oscar Wilde, recently published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons. It is a useful,
although often painful, ordeal—ventilating the store-room of your old gods.
There was a time when I worshipped Wilde unqualifiedly. As a freshman
I wrote a pathetic paper in which I demanded the canonization of the
author of <em>De Profundis</em>. Alas, I have come to discern spots on the sun.
</p>

<p>
As a decorative artist Wilde has no flaws. The perfect design applied
in his multifarious productions makes one compare him to the titans of
the High Renaissance: Nihil tetigit quod non ornavit. The graceful form
justifies even his obvious moral-fairy-tales, even his unoriginal, Keats-esque
and Poe-esque poems. It is for the style that we accept his <em>De Profundis</em>,
that insincerest attempt for sincerity. But Wilde strove for more than
mere external artistic effect. In his critical essays he lifted the critic to
the heights of co- and re-creation, and instructed him to demand from a
work of art eternal values. “The critic rejects those obvious modes of art
that have but one message to deliver and having delivered it become dumb
and sterile, and seeks rather for such modes as suggest reveries and moods
and by their imaginative beauty make all interpretations true and no interpretation
final.” We, his disciples in aesthetic valuations, come to our
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
master with his own criterion, and find him on more than one occasion
grievously wanting in the requirements that he had set up for the artist.
He either has no message to deliver, as in his clever plays, or he delivers
his message in such an outspoken way that no field is left for suggestion
or imaginative interpretation. He had transgressed Mallarmé’s maxim—“To
name is to kill; to suggest is to create” not only in <em>The Ballad of Reading
Gaol</em>, the work that belongs to the crushed, semi-penitent Wilde; he
committed this unpardonable sin in his masterpiece, <em>Salomé</em>! That wonderful
harmonious ghastliness, woven out of moods and motives, surcharged
with suggestive tragedy and fatalism, suddenly breaks into a criminal vulgarity
through the introduction of a “real” dead head, which drives away
illusion and atmosphere, and strikes your nostrils with the odor of theatrical
grease paint.
</p>

<p>
The rehabilitation of Oscar Wilde was imposed upon the Anglo-Saxon
world by the continent, especially by Germany, the expropriator of English
geniuses, where the production of Wilde’s plays has rivalled in frequency
those of Shakespeare. I know of a German pundit who chose as
a topic for his doctor’s dissertations “The Influence of Pater on Oscar
Wilde”. But continental depreciation is as fast as Anglo-Saxon appreciation
is slow. Neue Zeiten, neue Vögel; neue Vögel, neue Lieder. European
literature in recent decades has had more meteors than stars. Wilde’s
flash is rapidly vanishing. You may call me a Cassandra, but I venture a
prophecy that soon Wilde will find his peaceful place in American colleges
alongside with Austen, Eliot, Meredith, etc.
</p>

<p>
<em>Salomé</em> will always remain one of the world’s great symphonies,—a
symphony in which the motive of doom rends your soul from the first
sound to the last. <em>Poems in Prose</em> will never lose their charm as ivory-carved
bits of ideal conversation—the art in which Wilde was supreme,
the art that is almost unknown in this country where it is substituted by
talk. His other works are doomed to be time’s victims. Not because they
are worthless, but for the reason of their adaptability. One must be a
prophet, a Nietzsche, who hurls his seeds over many generations, in order
to endure. Wilde was aware of this danger, and he wished to be misunderstood,
but he lacked the profundity for such a merit. He did not
mirror his age; but he had realized the potentialities of his age, had popularized
them to such a degree that they have become the possession of the
crowd. We are not any longer dazzled by the clever witticisms in his <em>Plays</em>;
they have become almost commonplace. Even the graceful, radiating <em>Intentions</em>
appear to us somewhat obvious. Why?—It is the pathos of proximity!
Wilde’s paradoxes, <em>mots</em>, theories, have proven so appropriate, adaptable,
and digestible for our age, that it took only one decade to absorb
them into our blood and marrow. Cleverism for the sake of cleverism has
come to be an epidemic in our days; cleverists find Wilde an inexhaustible
source for parasitic exploitation. Our Hunekers (and under this appellative
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
I have in mind the legions of our omniscient boulevardiers-critics) don
a Wildesque robe, and have little trouble in passing as genuine before the
good-natured public. Unfortunately the constitution of the Hunekers is
too weak to absorb Wilde’s big truths; they prefer the digestible chaff.
</p>

<p>
Adaptability spells forgetability. Crime and punishment.

The Novelist

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> novelist is about to begin the writing of a novel. For a year he
will be at the task and what a year he will have! He is going to
write the story of Virginia Borden, daughter of Fan Borden, a Missouri
river raftsman. There in his little room he sits, a small, hunched-up figure
with a pencil in his hand. He has never learned to run a type-writer and
so he will write the words slowly and painfully, one after another on the
white paper.
</p>

<p>
What a multitude of words! For hours he will sit perfectly still,
writing madly and throwing the sheets about. That is a happy time. The
madness has possession of him. People will come in at the door and sit
about, talking and laughing. Sometimes he jumps out of his chair and
walks up and down. He lights and relights his pipe. Overcome with
weariness he goes forth to walk. When he walks he carries a heavy
walking stick and goes muttering along.
</p>

<p>
The novelist tries to shake off his madness but he does not succeed.
In a store he buys cheap writing tablets and, sitting on a stone near where
some men are building a house, begins again to write. He talks aloud
and occasionally fingers a lock of hair that falls down over his eyes. He
lets his pipe go out and relights it nervously.
</p>

<p>
Days pass. It is raining and again the novelist works in his room.
After a long evening he throws all he has written away.
</p>

<p>
What is the secret of the madness of the writer? He is a small man
and has a torn ear. A part of his ear has been carried away by the
explosion of a gun. Above the ear there is a spot, as large as a child’s
hand, where no hair grows.
</p>

<p>
The novelist is a clerk in a store in Wabash Avenue in Chicago. When
he was a quite young man he began to clerk in the store and for a time
promised to be successful. He sold goods, and there was something in his
smile that won its way into all hearts. How he liked the people who came
into the store and how the people liked him!
</p>

<p>
In the store now the novelist does not promise to be successful. There
is a kind of conspiracy in the store. Although he tries earnestly he continues
to make mistakes and all of his fellows conspire to forgive and
conceal his mistakes. Sometimes when he has muddled things badly they
are impatient and the manager of the store, a huge, fat fellow with thin
grey hair, takes him into a room and begins to scold.
</p>

<p>
The two men sit by a window and look down into Wabash Avenue.
It is snowing and people hurry along with bowed heads. So much do the
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
novelist and the fat grey-haired man like each other that the scolding
does not last. They begin to talk and the hours pass. Presently it is
time to close the store for the night and the two go down a flight of
stairs to the street.
</p>

<p>
On the corner <a id="corr-3"></a>stand the novelist and the store-manager, still talking.
Presently they go together to dine. The manager of the store looks at
his watch and it is eight o’clock. He remembers a dinner engagement
with his wife and hurries away. On the street car he blames himself for
his carelessness. “I should not have tried to reprimand the fellow,” he
says, and laughs.
</p>

<p>
It is night and the novelist works in his room. The night is cold
and he opens a window. There is, in his closet, a torn woolen jacket given
him by a friend, and he wraps the jacket about him. It has stopped snowing
and the stars are in the sky.
</p>

<p>
The talk with the store-manager has inflamed the mind of the novelist.
Again he writes furiously. What he is now writing will not fit into the
life-story of Virginia Borden but, for the moment, he thinks that it will
and he is happy. Tomorrow he will throw all away, but that will not
destroy his happiness.
</p>

<p>
Who is this Virginia Borden of whom the novelist writes and why
does he write of her? He does not know that he will get money for his
story and he is growing old. What a foolish affair. Presently there
may be a new manager in the store and the novelist will lose his place.
Once in a while he thinks of that and then he smiles.
</p>

<p>
The novelist is not to be won from his purpose. Virginia Borden
is a woman who lived in Chicago. The novelist has seen and talked with
her. Like the store-manager she forgot herself talking to him. She
forgot the torn ear and the bald spot where no hair grew and the skin
was snow white. To talk with the novelist was like talking aloud to herself.
It was delightful. For a year she knew him and then went away
to live with a brother in Colorado where she was thrown from a horse
and killed.
</p>

<p>
When she lived in Chicago many people knew Virginia Borden. They
saw her going here and there in the streets. Once she was married to a
man who was leader of an orchestra in a theater but the marriage was not
a success. Nothing that Virginia Borden did in the city was successful.
</p>

<p>
The novelist is to write the life-story of Virginia Borden. As he
begins the task a great humbleness comes over him. Tears come into his
eyes. He is afraid and trembles.
</p>

<p>
In the woman who talked and talked with him the novelist has seen
many strange, beautiful, unexpected little turns of mind. He knows that
in Virginia Borden there was spirit that, but for the muddle of life, might
have become a great flame.
</p>

<p>
It is the dream of the novelist that he will make men understand the
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
spirit of the woman they saw in the streets. He wants to tell the store-manager
of her and the little wiry man who has a desk next to his own.
In the Wabash Avenue store there is a woman who sits on a high stool with
her back to the novelist. He wants to tell her of Virginia Borden, to make
her see the reality of the woman who failed, to make all see that such a
woman once lived and went about among the women of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
As the novelist writes events grow in his mind. His mind is forever
active and he is continually making up stories about himself. As the
Virginia Borden whom men saw was a caricature of the Virginia Borden
who lived in the mind of the novelist, so he knows that he is himself but
a shadow of something very real.
</p>

<p>
And so the novelist puts himself into the book. In the book he is
a large, square-shouldered man with tiny eyes. He is one who came to
Chicago from a village in Poland and was leader of an orchestra in a
theatre. As the orchestra leader the novelist married Virginia Borden
and lived in a house with her.
</p>

<p>
You see the novelist wants to explain himself also. He is a lover
and so vividly does he love that he has the courage to love even himself.
And so it is the lover that sits writing and the madness of the writer is
the madness of the lover. As he writes he is making love. Surely all
can understand that!

Amy Lowell’s New Book

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">my</span> Lowell has sent me her book, <em>Six French Poets</em>,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a> who are:
Emile Verhaeren, Albert Samain, Remy de Gourmont, Henri de
Régnier, Francis Jammes, and Paul Fort; and it occurs to me that I must be
her severest critic—are we not rivals? When, in the summer of 1914, before
the war was dreamed of, she told me over her dinner-table of her intention to
write this book and of the names of the poets she had chosen, I objected to
Samain. Samain, I said, was exquisite, but not important; and he could
only be read a few pages at a time without weariness. Stuart Merrill and
Francis Vielé-Griffin, I went on, are both more considerable poets; and
both are Americans; and since you insist on including Remy de Gourmont
as one of your poets, you might increase your number to seven, in many
ways an appropriate number where poets are concerned; and so on. But
she only motioned the waiter to fill my glass with champagne; and what
can a man do against such argument and such a will? And now, even if
I wished to damn her book (I do not), she will have already heaped coals
of fire upon my head in her preface, where she says kind things about me
because I happened to mention the names of one or two books to her,
information she did not really need.
</p>

<p>
Miss Lowell states that she has “made no attempt at an exhaustive
critical analysis of the various works” of her poets. “Rather, I have tried
to suggest certain things which appear to the trained poet while reading
them. The pages and pages of hair-splitting criticism turned out by erudite
gentlemen for their own amusement has been no part of my scheme. But
I think the student, the poet seeking new inspiration, the reader endeavoring
to understand another poetic idiom, will find what they need to set
them on their way.” That is so: this book contains six causeries in which
Miss Lowell tells you why she loves these poets, and what she loves about
them, interrupting her talk every now and then to read some poem to you
which illustrates her meaning, introducing every now and then a fragment
of biography to correspond with the stage of the poet’s work to which she
has brought you, or stopping every now and then to pick out rare phrases
and rare music of words for your especial delight. No one, I suppose, will
have listened to Miss Lowell’s causerie in so happy a setting as the sitting-room
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
on the third floor of a hotel in Piccadilly in which she talked to us
in the August of 1914. Through the long French window open in the
corner could be seen the length of Piccadilly, its great electric globes, its
shining roadway, and, on the left, the tops of the trees of Green Park,
dark grey in the moonlight; the noise of the motorbusses and of the taxis
reached us in a muted murmur, and at the corner of the park opposite,
beneath a street lamp, stood a newsboy, whose headlines we strained our
eyes from time to time to catch. It was in this tenseness created by the
expectation of news that Miss Lowell read Paul Fort and Henri de Régnier
to us (she reads French beautifully); and it is the emotion of those evenings,
more than anything else, that her book brings back to me. This
is not criticism, I know; but I am a critic displumed. I have quoted Miss
Lowell’s statement of her aims; let me now give my impression of what
she has done. You can take up her book, and read it from beginning to
end without weariness or boredom; you will be continually interested,
continually delighted, continually moved. Miss Lowell’s method of quoting
whole poems and long poems as well as detached and beautiful fragments
has filled her book with an emotional content that almost makes me afraid
to open it; the fear of too much beauty. And, finally, she has flattered the
sense of personal superiority in us all by allowing little slips to remain
where we may find them, and preen ourselves on our cleverness. When
you have absorbed all these sensations, you will have come to Appendix
A, which is 140 pages of the finest translations into English that exist of
the six poets in question, or, it might truly be said, of the French poets
of the symbolist generation. In these translations, Miss Lowell has rarely
been tempted away from prose, and you have only to compare her work
with the work of other translators to be immediately aware of how much
she has gained by her prudence, her artistry had better be said. That
Miss Lowell had all the equipment for a task of this kind, her own two
books of poems left no doubt at all. In them you will find the same delight
in beautiful word and phrase which has undoubtedly led her to modern
French poetry as to a friendly country, and to the achievement in these
translations. If she had done nothing more than just publish these, she
would have earned our gratitude; but she offers them to you as the least
of her book (as an appendix!) after you have been amused, interested,
instructed and moved. I can conceive of no greater pleasure—my pleasure
in the book is of a different kind—than that of the lover of poetry who
reads in Miss Lowell’s book about modern French poetry for the first time;
it must be like falling into El Dorado. I should add that the book contains
an excellent signed photograph of each poet.

the Prussians, a sick man, a great artist in words to be read
with delight and—your tongue in your cheek.” This is from John
Galsworthy’s “Second Thoughts on this War” in the January <em>Scribner’s</em>.
And so it goes on: he identifies Nietzsche with the new
German philosophy (which the poor man would have hated as he
did Prussianism), he talks of the Will to Power and the Will to
Love as two forces at opposite poles (quite in the manner of the
Chestertons), and he derides Shaw’s clear-headed understanding
that there is no real struggle of ideals involved in the war as the
statement of a brilliant intellect with “no flair, no feelers, none of
that instinctive perception of the essence and atmosphere of things
which is a so much surer guide than reason.” These things are
heart-breaking. If the artists can not understand the prophets of

The average conservative is a ghastly figure, but at least he

Margaret Sanger’s trial is set for the twenty-fourth of this
month. She is under three indictments, based on twelve articles,
eleven of which are for <em>printing the words</em>—“prevention of conception.”
It is these words which are regarded as “lewd, lascivious,
and obscene.”
</p>

<p>
Many “radicals” have advised Mrs. Sanger that the wisest thing
to do is to plead guilty to this “obscenity” charge and to throw
herself upon the mercy of the court—which would mean that she
could get off with a light sentence or a small fine. And what would
become of her object, which has been to remove the term “prevention
of conception” from this section of the penal code, where it
has been labelled as filthy, vile, and obscene? No revolution has
ever been started by evasion. No one wants Margaret Sanger to
be a martyr. <em>The point is that every one must see to it that she is
not made a martyr.</em> There is no other way out of these issues. You
can’t really believe in a thing without knowing that some time
you will have to fight for it. Margaret Sanger is taking the stand
that her type always takes—just because it is the type that insists
on believing hard. <em>We</em> should do all the rest. If you will wire
your protest to the District Attorney, office of U. S. Marshal, Post
Office Building, New York City, it will help. You may write Margaret
Sanger, or send contributions to her, care of Ethel Byrne,

<p class="subt">
(An Indefinite Comment)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> report, without regret, my inability to present a definite article about
the Annual Exhibit of American Painters and Sculptors. Not that the
exhibit is vague—American art is a definite thing: travelling collections,
annual exhibits, “friends” and organizations have made it so. But visit
after visit left me without words. The feelings I did have were alternately
those of amusement, anger, disgust, indifference, mild excitement, and most
of the time: “Oh well, what’s the use?”
</p>

<p>
In this exhibit the only thrills or “artiste emotions”—such as one
demands of art—were very minor notes and immediately they were felt—thump!
(Register amazement and then anger.) You come across something
good: its neighbors and surroundings deaden its appeal. Thus,
Massonovich’s <em>Moon-Dark</em>—poet’s magic! But alas! it is the only landscape
in the exhibit. Next to it is Oliver D. Grover’s Italian platitude,
near it a Redfield—“blast” his “school” of landscapes, please, someone!
Peyraud, Stacey, Butler—oh, what emptiness! The Inness Room cuts into
the exhibit separating two rooms from the rest of the galleries. Passing
through it one is reminded of the Inness tradition—how it has been ignored!
Or at least how his spirit has been ignored. Monet, Renoir, Manet, and
some other modern French are hanging elsewhere in the Institute; and
then there is Whistler; and again recall Inness; Massonovich, on you rests
the perpetuation, not of “American Landscape” but of that spirit we shall
always be searching for in landscapes, if landscapes we must have. One
parting remark about landscapes. Hayley Lever comes in for some praise
and much scolding. He has a good color sense, but strength and virility
in composition seem to be lacking. Recall what Jerome Blum has done
and you will understand why this half-way person ought to be jolted.
</p>

<p>
And the portraits. One of Katherine Dudley’s decorative-German-poster-“Every
Week” cover-design-women, is now the property of the
“Friends”—“American Art as it was in the early part of the twentieth century”.
Yes, indeed, to represent it clearly to posterity you must include
at least one of the numerous society dilettantes. However, Gordon Stevenson,
Blows, Henri, and Davey as portrait painters are worth watching.
</p>

<p>
And the rest of the show? Most of the exhibitors have been represented
for years. Their pictures are all so familiar. Many of the paintings
have appeared year after year. Birge Harrison has a rather atmospheric
beach scene; Beal, Albright, Dougherty, Hassam, Sargent, Mary Cassatt,
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
Symons, Ballin, Weir, Schofield. All are familiar and recognised in the
Market Place. These people are standing still. I imagine they are old:
grey without magnificence. And being haunted by the truth of that lingering
statement that there is no such thing as an old <em>artist</em>—why, dare we
say that they are <em>not</em> artists?
</p>

<p>
Sculptor? There is none.

who had spoken was considered not a high-brow but just a good normal
cultured woman. Not being a fanatic about art, or anything else, for
that matter, she knew absolutely what she was talking about. The thing
she was talking about was a painting of Grant Park by Frank C. Peyraud
looking east from the top of some Michigan Boulevard office building....
It was indeed “real.” Peyraud’s one-man exhibit at the Art Institute
shows him up for what he is—an imitator without imagination, a reproducer,
a copyist of nature in her most obvious moods. Not an artist or a
creator his landscapes are all “real,” “true-to-life” and they are all enjoyed....
The Public knows where the originals are and the association
and comparison gives them pleasure and the artist fame....

hear that played again!” A woman speaks—not the one referred to above
but one who holds the same position in her set towards music as her
friend towards “art” in her circle.... Of course, she can appreciate
music, when it is so natural and real.... Carpenter is to be congratulated:
the percussions are given a splendid and unusual chance to show
their versatility—it is they, it seems to me, and they alone who benefit by
this splendid display of music.

“My dear, I just love Stevenson and you know, my dear, those places
in his novels are <em>so</em> real—you can just see them so plainly. Of course,
I’ve never been in Scotland or England or France or, my dear, even in
New York but really Stevenson is so descriptive, his stories are <em>so</em> gripping
it really is as good as traveling. And I have a lovely new book,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-3" id="fnote-3">[3]</a> just out
with beautiful pictures and awfully dear binding, showing how the places
Stevenson describes actually exist! You know this book amounts to a
liberal education—it’s just the same as going abroad. I just adore places
and scenes and travel in books—don’t you? And Stevenson,” she ended
with a sigh, “is <em>so</em> romantic.” Which reminds me of a line of the Intolerable
Wilde’s in a letter from Reading—“I see that romantic surroundings
are the worst surroundings possible for romantic writers.” ... “And,
my dear, it brings Art so close to everyday life, does it not?—to have
artists portray for us our everyday surroundings and show us how nice
they are.”

Long, long ago one Woman spoke to an Artist—will her type <em>never</em>

A Brilliant Enemy
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Modern Painting, by Willard Huntington Wright.
New York: John Lane Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> is a hard book. None of Clive Bell’s sunny cynicism, none of
Kandinsky’s colorful musicalness; surely nothing in common with the
watery ecstacies of our official Chicago modernist, Arthur Jerome Eddy.
While reading the voluminous book I experienced an uneasy, an uncertain
feeling in regard to the author: to hate him, or just to dislike him? Let
me confess that when I turned over the last page I lowered my head in
respect for a brilliant enemy.
</p>

<p>
It is a hard book, brothers-dilettanti. It gives us a merciless thrashing,
we who love without being able to state why and wherefore. We are
ordered to go to school, children, to study chemistry and color, to approach
a work of art as scientifically equipped as a surgeon venturing to operate
on a human body. As a reward we are promised the bliss of unadulterated
aesthetic emotion. Ah, that aesthetic emotion! For a time we believed
that it was possible to grasp that slippery “blue bird” by following Clive
Bell’s maxim on the significance of form. Alas, this theory is obsolete.
Color itself should become form, proclaims Mr. Wright, and he quotes the
manifesto of his beloved Synchromists: “In our painting color becomes
the generating function. Painting being the art of color, any quality of
a picture not expressed by color is not painting!”
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of relief we reach the chapter on Synchromism. All art
up to the year 1912 has been nothing but preliminary experimentation. In
Rubens were consummated the aims of the old painters (beginning with
the fifteenth century; the Primitives are dismissed as not deserving consideration)—organization
and composition. The new cycle opens in the
nineteenth century with Turner, Constable, and Delacroix, who experiment
in naturalism. Manet introduces thematic freedom—not more. The
Impressionists and Neo-Impressionists close the second, naturalistic, cycle,
having enriched art with laborious investigations into the secrets of color
in relation to light. All these have been but precursors forging weapons
for the third and <em>last</em> (!) cycle—the final purification of painting. Synchromism,
of course. Of this last cycle Cezanne was—hear, Messieurs and
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
Mesdames Questioners—the primitive! Still Cezanne and Matisse and
Picasso ignored color as a generator of form, until two Americans, MacDonald-Wright
and Russell, rent asunder the ultimate veil from purity
and truth, and the new and final deity emanated from their canvasses, the
unsurpassable Synchromism.
</p>

<p>
There is so much truth in Mr. Wright’s statements, particularly in his
negative statements, that we may disregard his fanatic credo. Who will
deny that painting has been “a bastard art—an agglomeration of literature,
religion, photography, and decoration”? Who will not approve of the
efforts of modern painters to eliminate all extraneous considerations and
make painting as pure an art as music? But why dogmatize again and
anew? Why reduce creative art to scientific formulae, to mathematical
calculations, to Procrustean standards? Why ridicule those who paint
<em>comme l’oiseau chante</em>? Why belittle Kandinsky for his too-subjective
symphonies? Why be so hard, Mr. Wright, so finite, so sententious, so
encyclical? Why not have a little sense of humor, pray?
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="GORKYSMEMORIES">
Gorky’s Memories
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>My Childhood, by Maxim Gorky.
New York: The Century Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That Gorky is deteriorating has become a truism. Exaggerated as
the importance of his early works has been, one could not deny their
freshness, elementary adroitness, soulfulness. But the god-fire was soon
exhausted in the none-too-deep spirit of the tramp-poet. He gave us the
few good songs he knew about the life of the has-beens, and then went
hoarse. The public, Hauptmann’s Huhn, is not irresponsible for Gorky’s
false notes. Compel the canary to imitate the nightingale and the poor
bird will lose her short, simple, pretty twitter, and rend her little heart
with shrill ejaculations. I have in mind Gorky’s later dramas and stories.
</p>

<p>
The book before me makes me think that Gorky has come to recognize
his fallacy in attempting to treat subjects alien to his inherent capacity. At
any rate in this case he is free from pretentiousness. His childhood memories
are related simply, realistically, sans philosophizing, sans allegorizing.
It is left for the reader to deduce the “moral” from the sordid panorama
that is revealed before him, that malodorous dunghill swarming with human
beings, whose crawling and writhing is called life. The book should have
been much shorter; the super-abundance of details makes it Dreiserian or
Bennetian.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
And here I should like to touch upon a sore which reviewers customarily
do not discuss, for fear of <em>mauvais ton</em>. Why are the English translations
so careless and comical? The book in question is full of such glaring
errors, such nonsensical misunderstandings, such atrocious ignorance, that
it has made me pull my hair in despair of solving the dilemma whether I
should laugh at the comicalness or whether I should rage at the impertinence.
I am quite sure that the translator (his name is not revealed) knows
as much Russian as Percy Pinkerton, the crucifier of Artzibashev; he mutilated
Gorky from a German translation, I suspect. The book has another
jolly feature—illustrations. They are reproductions from popular Russian
paintings, with inscriptions that are supposed to illustrate the text. The
naive forgery is too crude and unskilful to mislead even the unsuspecting
reader. Will the publishers ever acquire respect for the printed word?

New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons.</em>
</p>

<p class="book">
<em>Some Musicians of Former Days, by Romain Rolland.
New York: Henry Holland Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
These books, like the preceding one, are intended to be instructive;
they attain their purpose, however, thanks to gracefulness of style and
fascination of subject. Mr. Miyamori has condensed the plots of the most
famous <em>joruri</em>—the epical dramas of the Yeddo period, which are to this
day chanted in Japanese theatres. It is an exotic atmosphere of oriental
fairyland, tapestries of childlike love and naive passion, of smiling bloody
tragedies and blissful harakiris. When lovers are prevented from being
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
married they do not employ the cumbersome process of elopment, but
transport themselves into the other world by committing <em>shinju</em> or double
suicide. The author tells us that Metizahormach shinju dramas have had
such powerful influence on the audiences that there have been numerous
instances of lovers performing that delicious suicide after leaving the
theatre. I fear that for the occidental reader the dramas will not prove
as convincing—alas.
</p>

<p>
After <em>Musicians of To-Day</em> the last book of Rolland has little appeal.
Journalistic notes, interesting information, brilliant suggestions—and we
look in vain for the profound spirit of the old Romain.

<em>Anthology of Magazine Verse for 1915, by William Stanley Braithwaite.
New York: Gomme and Marshall.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Mr. Braithwaite has chosen the guests for his house party with kindly
catholicity. Amy Lowell, John Gould Fletcher, and H. D. sit uncomfortably
in his New England parlor eyeing one another furtively. Clement
Wood clowns in a corner. Vachel Lindsay before the mantel-piece declaims
to James Oppenheim and Louis Untermeyer, who listen with an air of
importance. Edgar Lee Masters sits on the <em>corpus juris</em> and meditates
upon the beauties of silence. Sara Teasedale dances in the hallway. Harriet
Monroe reclines on a porch chair, listening to the rain. A crowd in
the library recreate themselves by reading from a set of British Poets.
Percy MacKaye gloomily reads the war news to a group in the dining-room,
while little Arvia, his daughter, lisps happily to herself. And alone
in the kitchen is Robert Frost roasting chestnuts.
</p>

<p>
Who will say that Mr. Braithwaite could have better performed the
duties of host? Did he omit any of the “older established names”? And
did he not make a special Cook’s tour to far off islands (not shown in the
atlas of the <em>Boston Transcript</em> office) for the purpose of bringing home
with him certain “new discoveries”?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Braithwaite pats his guests admiringly upon the back and regrets
that there are other excellent poets for whom he has no accommodations.
Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington, T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, Maxwell
Bodenheim, perhaps he will invite you next time. Is it not a pleasant
anticipation?

Empty Souls
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Later Life, by Louis Couperus.
New York: Dodd, Mead and Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This is the second part of the tetralogy of “Small Souls” which began
to appear in English last year. The slowly-developing epic is pregnant
with promises, but, oh how slowly the skein unrolls. We are still in the
midst of Dutch bourgeoisie, dull, stony-faced, petty, filthy; again the
incessant rain, ever-cloudy skies, bicycle rides, large dinner-parties at
Mama’s. Small souls. Last year I asked the question whether in depicting
Dutch life Couperus could not find a single big soul, one interesting individual.
This second book gives us pale glimmers of potentialities, very
pale indeed. The big man is big only relatively; he has been in America,
worked in factories, and is now ... lecturing on peace.
</p>

<p>
The book introduces a feature that may interest the sexologist: frequent
passionate love among near kinsmen. Two sisters are in love with
their brothers. A romance between uncle and niece. The heroes and
heroines are awakened to love for the most part at the dangerous age of
forty. I recall that Przybyszewski presents in two of his works love between
brother and sister. Shall we say that ideal sex-relationship requires
the closest kinship of body and spirit? In the Pole’s lovers the force driving
them together is the harmonious coincidence of two morbidly developed intellects
with a common craving for beauty and fullness. In Couperus we
face mutual yearning of small, pale, empty souls. But I am not interested
in sex-problems, not yet.

<em>We have had cancellations, congratulations, and a lot of indignant letters

these stories are among the best things</em> <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> <em>has printed.
With the exception of some of the poetry and two stories of Sherwood
Anderson’s, they may be listed as the only “literature” we have published.
Some one has compared them to Gorky. But this is not a very accurate
judgment. As a reviewer pointed out in the November issue, Gorky could
feel his stories, could imagine them deeply, but he could never quite tell
them. The supreme virtue of Ben Hecht’s “Dregs” is that he could tell
them. That is the art. Of course I have nothing to say to those people
who deplore Mr. Hecht’s subject matter and urge me to use some moral
judgment in selecting things for</em> <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. <em>There is no such
thing as moral judgment in literature. There should be no such thing in
life, but unfortunately</em>—

</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Little Review</span>—how <em>could</em> you do it? You who have hitherto held so bravely to
the tenets of beauty and truth in thought and expression, held to them courageously
through storms of adverse criticism, consent to print descriptions of the bestial abnormalities

realization of life, consent to crawl in the gutter with the vermin, what can we expect

<p>
May I call your attention to the fact that Mr. Edward J. O’Brien, in his annual
review of the year’s fiction, not only lists all the stories printed in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
during 1915 among those possessing “distinction,” but double-asterisks (verb) the
three sketches of Ben Hecht’s published under the title “Dregs.” This in the chaste
and genealogical Boston Evening Transcript! And, following to the best of my
ability Mr. O’Brien’s rather vague reference to and nebulous listings of the stories
to be published in his anthology, <em>The Best Stories of 1915 and Year Book of American
Fiction</em>, I can but come to the startled conclusion that Ben Hecht’s three stories are
all to be reprinted in the estimable collection. Good for Ben Hecht, <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span>, and Mr. O’Brien’s catholicity of judgment! Some of us there are who like
to have our opinions backed and bolstered by authority. And what more august
authority than the printed word of Boston. Some of us—but of course not your
insurgents. Perhaps Mr. Hecht will resent congratulations. I tender them, nevertheless—with
apologies. Good stuff, Ben Hecht! Do us some—more of them.

<p>
I’m truly grateful to your reviewer who found my play, <em>The State Forbids</em>, “negative
as literature.” If he had found it bad architecture or mediocre sculpture I
should have been less pleased.
</p>

<p>
Play making, to my mind, is not a form of literature (even though its medium
chances to be words) but it is an art of spacing ... focusing ... building. Structure
upon structure! Foundation. Ornament. Design. An art as distinct from other
forms of word utility as color medium is from plastic art. Drama is related to literature
only in so far as all arts are inter-related. No more than this. By drama I
mean, of course, plays intended (at least in the writer’s mind) for production. These
alone are plays. For one reason or another they may never reach the boards, but
they must have lived in the writer’s fantasy as things produced. <em>Desk drawer dramas</em>
are not plays.
</p>

<p>
I believe that the hope of the modern drama lies in the artist who can learn to
look upon himself as a builder ... a <em>maker</em> and not a writer of plays.
</p>

<p>
And so again I thank your critic whose charity has made me feel that I am on
the road which leads to “Somewhere.” Even though at the end of my journey I
may not yet have reached the first mile stone.

Years ago an editor sent me to the government hospital for the insane just outside

gentleman of profoundly respectful manner presented me with a neatly-bound pamphlet

it later, the cover-page proved to be a mass of meaningless, whirling lines labeled in
carefully printed letters, “The Croucher At The Door.” The reading matter was
wholly unintelligible.

A poet-friend has given me the October number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. The

that he is in a cafe, surrounded by a “cortege of seven waiters,” mourning for a

Maybe you think this is funny, but certainly it is not intended to be. Seriousness,
thick, black, dense seriousness is the keynote of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. This is vers
libre with a vengeance. “Persons will come out and shake legs. I do not want legs
shaken.” Here we have the spirit of the dance! It is quite evident Mr. Ficke does
not wish joy to be unconfined.
</p>

<p>
There have been many descriptions of dawn, probably none so unique as “the
dawn spilled across the blackness like a scrambled egg on the skillet.” The second
verse is short and to the point, but it is much to be thankful for both in point of
length and the statement that we are abhorred.

<em>Huntly Carter, London</em>:
</p>

<p>
The letter by C. Smith of Chicago, in the October issue of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>,
is so phenomenally stupid and so intellectually dishonest that it is almost beneath
notice. If I consent to notice it, I do so in order to warn Smithsonian understudies
that they will be severely dealt with if they attempt to repeat Smith’s brazen offence
of writing to a significant journal and coolly suggesting that a single and relatively
unimportant wrong attribution is to be regarded as a fair and honest sample of the
whole subject matter of an article occupying several pages and mainly devoted to a
metaphysical explanation of the origin and nature of poetry. Furthermore, suggesting
that I am applying to a poet (Browning) a rigid test of poetry, seeking to prove
his words poetically good or bad by my poetical experience, when as a matter of
fact I am offering certain words, some of which are wrongly attributed to Browning,
as indisputable evidence that in venting the emotions versifiers find descriptive figures
efficacious.
</p>

<p>
No doubt some of the words flaunted by Smith are wrongly attributed to Browning.
They are so wrongly attributed that anyone can see they are wrongly attributed.
And any “sane, intelligent and decently responsible man” (to use Smith’s yellow press
tautology) would have given me an opportunity of saying they are wrongly attributed
before venturing to put on silly airs of hypercriticism. Then he would have learnt
that the first and third line of the quotation belong oddly enough, to another piece of
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
poetry, and have got mixed up with Browning’s stuff in some unaccountable way. I
have not the least idea how the mix took place. All I know is that my article was
finished off in great haste to catch the mail. It was sent in handscript and not typescript.
And there was no time to send me a proof; otherwise the quotation would
certainly have been corrected, and the many errors which now appear in my article
would have disappeared. I feel I am justified in saying it was not my intention to send
the words which have crept into print by the discovery that I have actually written
down Browning’s very words. Here is Browning:
</p>

  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">And the sun looked over the mountain’s rim:</p>

      <p class="verse">And the need of a world of men for me.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="noindent">
The first line of the verse is missing. The three lines however serve the purpose of
my comparison. I had also set down these lines by Browning:

<p class="noindent">
I intended to include this with my quotations. For here in my view is a figure
as original and precisely felicitous as anything the Imagists have given us.
</p>

<p>
That this dragging in of some wrongly attributed words—so obviously wrong
as to deceive no one—for the sole purpose of discrediting an important article is dishonest,
is clear from the fact that Smith does not drag in any other quotation from
the many given, nor produce any other evidence whatsoever in support of his contention
that my article is inept and careless throughout. In fact he has nothing more
damaging to offer than his own fatuous statement that he happens “to consider my
article an ill-digested congeries of vague views”; which, when one comes to examine
it is found to contain a baseless assertion and a clear admission that my article is
above and beyond Smith’s head.
</p>

<p>
As to the silliness of Smith’s letter, this may be judged from the following:
Smith begins with the generalization that magazines die “whose pages are as a rule
careless, inconsidered and inept” (note the repetition and consequent lack of thoroughness).
The publications of the capitalist press answer this description. The news
sheets, for instance, are rotten with carelessness, inconsideredness and ineptness. They
would be rottener if they could. Yet they do not die. On the contrary they sell by
the million. If so, then <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> should sell by the million. But Smith
says it will die. And Smith is a careful, serviceable, and accurate man.
</p>

<p>
By way of comparison Smith relieves himself of this matchless composition.
“Your magazine will die,—as a steam engine would grow useless in which no direction
towards any cylinder was given to the indubitable forces generated in the boiler.”
What is the precise meaning of this bombastic twaddle? In homely words, it means
that a steam engine is (not “would grow”) useless when the steam power developed in
its boiler is not utilised in any cylinder. Anyone who examines this analogy will
agree with me that Smith is a careful, serviceable, and accurate man.
</p>

<p>
From the general Smith comes to the particular and quotes what he is pleased to
call an example of my “ineptitude and carelessness” as an example of the general “ineptitude
and carelessness” of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. Without knowing anything as to
the circumstances under which the wrongly attributed words found their way into
print, without stopping to inquire to what extent I contributed to the mistake, and
upon no other evidence whatsoever than the said wrongly attributed words, he proceeds
to saddle me with the astounding intention “to obliterate all sense of accuracy,
all love of clear and rational communication, all fidelity to honest statement, and all
interest in truth” (which makes four ways of uttering the same inverifiable statement).
</p>

<p>
Finally Smith challenges the editor of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> to print his ghastly
ineptitude. She has taken the short way and done so. It serves Smith right.

<em>M. Silverman, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
Your last issue is a failure—with two exceptions, Miss Goldman’s article on
“Preparedness” and Mr. Hecht’s letter. Both of them are human, understandable,
and sincere. They shout—but do not roar. All the others are ostentatious, plebeian,
and lack artistic restraint. They are not beautiful. They <em>holler</em> and produce a sense
of heaviness and overexertion. Sympathy and politeness are apparently the cardinal
virtues of the highly esteemed editor. Hence this “democratic” hash.
</p>

<p>
To be more specific: Your editorial, “Toward Revolution,” is the acme of nonsense.
I tried to take you seriously but I couldn’t. It is pamphletory, and should
have no place in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.
</p>

<p>
“The Ecstasy of Pain” is a stage hurricane, and, to paraphrase Mr. Goldbeck, it
is like Chicago: vast, but not impressive. It lacks artistic touch and symmetrical
wholeness. The fourth paragraph is excellent. The rest was unnecessary. The
fragmentary mind of Mr. Kaun is phosphorescent, produces tiny sparks which are
soon lost in the darkness. Higher mathematics is the best remedy for Mr. Kaun’s
mind.
</p>

<p>
“The Spring Recital” is a bore. The author of <em>The “Genius”</em> seems to have a
mania for torturing the innocent public. I read “The Spring Recital” twice, yes
twice; and when I got through with it I felt extremely uncomfortable. I don’t understand
it and it doesn’t mean anything to me. I challenge anyone to explain to me:
What does this piece of “dramatic” “quatch” mean?
</p>

<p>
All the other articles—well, they are harmless.
</p>

<p class="from">
<em>Woods Dargan, Darlington, S. C.</em>:
</p>

<p>
I enclose a check for $1.50, and ask that you enter my name for one year’s subscription—that
is, if you will let one of the rabble creep in. Frankly, I know no more
about art (with a capital A or otherwise) than a rabbit. I don’t even know what
an “Imagist” is! And for the life of me I cannot understand why the temperamental,
fussy gentleman named Alexander S. Kaun should not use a singular verb with a
singular noun, just like ordinary people. But when he says, as he does in the first
line of the fourth paragraph of his article, “the dearer a person or a thing <em>are</em> to me,
etc.,” I know there must be intellectual purpose in it, some esoteric effect that gets
to the cultured few but passes over my head; so I bow before the unknown beauty
of it, thinking, “Odd, but no doubt it’s all right.”
</p>

<p>
Also, to my untutored mind, the frequent use of profanity in an everyday, conversational
way in two or three of the articles is amusing, and makes me wonder.
It reminds me of the days when I first took up the art, and used to feel a shudder of
delight when I ripped out a good, mouth-filling, “Damn it all to hell!” Perhaps it has
lost its charm for me as a literary ornament because I swear so much myself, just as
a matter of habit without deriving the oldtime pleasure from it.
</p>

<p>
Other places where these boys put it all over me are in music and Russians. It
is one of my secret sorrows that I know I know nothing about music. I like it, but
it never occurs to me to fade away and fill an early grave if I hear somebody’s nocturne
murdered—that is, if I know it is being murdered, which is highly unlikely. And
as to the Russians, old Dostoevsky is my limit so far, but I’m game, and am going
in for all the others,—the more gloomy and morbid the better.
</p>

<p>
Then, there’s this Mr. Theodore Dreiser. As we say in this neck of the woods,
in our uncouth manner, “He must be a bear-cat.” (By the way, I’d give a lot to know
what “demiurge” means in the sense in which it is applied to him. Mr. Masters used it
in <em>The New York Times</em> some weeks ago, and now I find it again in Mr. Powys’
appreciation. I don’t know what they mean.) Well, I’ve had his book, <em>The “Genius,”</em>
for sometime, and mean to read it all as soon as I can get round to it. Perhaps I’ll
know what “demiurge” means then—but I doubt it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
For all that I have said I would not have you think that I am wholly lacking in
soul. I have some things in common with these fellows, for I have no religion or
morals, and I enjoy getting drunk, riotously, gloriously drunk, once or twice a year.
</p>

<p>
And now, after telling you at more length than any decent person should what
has puzzled me in your Review, permit me to say what I like. The first part of your
own contribution, “Life Itself,” strikes me as the real thing. I understand all that,
being a common person. For the last part, as I’ve said, I know nothing of art, and
life doesn’t mean those things to me, naturally. But I like it. I can, after a fashion,
see how it <em>might</em> mean them. The review of Dreiser by Mr. Powys that I have mentioned
already is good writing and good sense. How true it is, I am not yet in a position
to guess. Then, Mr. Edgar Masters always writes vividly, deeply. I am glad to
add “So We Grew Together” to what I know of his stuff. It is almost as good a
portrait and short story as some of the best of the Anthology.
</p>

<p>
That fellow Ben Hecht can write. Personally, I have a sort of leaning toward
the dregs, but, as a general thing, I don’t know that there’s much use in writing
about them just so. But he’s certainly good. He can write. I never heard of him
before, but I shall look out for him in future.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of what I find good I’m willing to put up with what I fail to grasp,
and so I look forward to much pleasure and instruction from <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.
Luck to it. As long as you, Miss Lowell, Mr. Masters, and Mr. Hecht contribute,
so long will it be cheap at any price. And, who knows? I may yet learn from my
friend Mr. Kaun the hidden beauties of a singular subject with a plural verb.

Free Coal to Those Who Can’t<br />
Afford to Buy It
</p>

    <div class="s">
<p>
Nobody is going to be cold this winter if the Consumers Company can help it. We even
want those who can’t afford to pay for coal now, to use Consumers coal, because at some time
in the future their circumstances may change; they may be able to pay for coal then and if they
once use Consumers coal they will never use any other. In any event we want them to keep warm.
</p>

<p>
You can call it either charity or advertising, it makes no difference to us as long as we
accomplish the results we are after, but we will give 50 pounds of coal free every day, as we
have for the past three winters, on presentation at any of our yards listed below of our coal
certificates which may be had from any Physician, Minister, Priest, Rabbi, Newspaper, the Salvation
Army, the Volunteers of America, Associated Charities, the Visiting Nurses Association, any
Woman’s Club or Charitable Organization. And we give it freely without any fuss or foolishness.
</p>

    </div>
<p>
Last year we distributed 70,720 fifty-pound lots of Consumers coal. You may
call them advertising samples or charity just as you choose. In either event we <em>know</em>
that we kept <em>70,720 families warm</em>. This is our Christmas offering and in this manner
<em>we propose to make Christmas last all winter</em>. If we profit by it later—when
these good folks are in position to become <em>paying</em> customers, you won’t care, will you?
We think not.

THE BLAST
</p>

<p>
These days of great struggles urgently demand a militant labor voice to aid
the workers in their battles.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Blast</em> will be such a voice. A revolutionary labor weekly, edited by
ALEXANDER BERKMAN.
</p>

<p>
The time has come to gather together, so to speak, the scattered forces of
discontent and help them find definite expression.
</p>

<p>
I am planning to have for <em>The Blast</em> regular correspondences from the
various industrial centers of America, Europe and Australia. I hold that one
of the most important things in the publication of a revolutionary weekly is to
keep the rebels throughout the world in closer touch with each other and informed
of the labor and revolutionary situation in the different countries. It
helps to stimulate the spirit of solidarity and encourage activity.
</p>

<p>
The other departments of <em>The Blast</em> will be: a strong anti-militarism and
anti-preparedness column; a page dealing with the vital, social and economic
questions; a “Chain Gang” department, containing news from Labor’s prisoners
of war—on trial and in prison—stories of prison life, etc.; a column devoted to
the discussion of special labor questions and general human problems; a Children’s
Department, with the view of ultimately establishing a circle of Ferrer
Schools throughout the country.
</p>

<p>
First issue of <em>The Blast</em>, January 15th, 1916.
</p>

<p>
The life of the paper and the success of its work will depend upon <em>your</em>
interest and co-operation.

play by Artzibashef. It is a war drama which has stimulated thinking
people in Russia to think some more. A penetrating study of
Eugene Walter as the leader of dramatic realism in America and
a scintillating essay on the folly of theatrical advertising are two of
other articles which combine to make the February issue invaluable
to people who are interested not only in drama but in life.</span>

If you have never been willing to spend
$25 for a talking machine this is your chance.
</p>

<p>
The MUSIGRAPH is as large, good-looking,
right-sounding as machines selling for $25.
</p>

<p>
How do we do it? Here’s the answer: Gigantic
profits have been made from $25 machines because of
patent right monopoly. Millions have gone for advertising
$25 machines, and these millions came back
from the public. The attempt is to make $25 the standard price. It’s too much.
</p>

<p>
The trust price game is broken. Here is a machine which gives perfect satisfaction
(guaranteed) for only <b>$10</b>. It will fill your home with dancing, good music, fun and happiness.
<b>Money back if it isn’t as represented.</b> MUSIGRAPHS are selling by the
thousands. People who can afford it buy showy autos, but common-sense people gladly ride
Fords—both get over the ground. Same way with talking machines, only the MUSIGRAPH
looks and works like the high-priced instruments.

<b>WHAT BETTER CHRISTMAS GIFT CAN YOU THINK OF? Musigraphs

We are advertising these big bargain machines through our customers—one MUSIGRAPH
in use sells a <b>dozen more</b>.
</p>

<p>
One cash payment is our plan. So to-day, <b>to insure Christmas delivery</b>, send $10,

Ignorance Is the Great Curse!
</p>

<p>
Do you know, for instance, the scientific difference between love and passion?
Human life is full of hideous exhibits of wretchedness due to ignorance of sexual
normality.
</p>

<p>
Stupid, pernicious prudery long has blinded us to sexual truth. Science was
slow in entering this vital field. In recent years commercialists eyeing profits have
unloaded many unscientific and dangerous sex books. Now the world’s great
scientific minds are dealing with this subject upon which human happiness often
depends. No longer is the subject tabooed among intelligent people.
</p>

<p>
<b>We take pleasure in offering to the American public, the work of one of the
world’s greatest authorities upon the question of sexual life. He is August
Forel, M.D., Ph.D., LL.D., of Zurich, Switzerland. His book will open your
eyes to yourself and explain many mysteries. You will be better for this
knowledge.</b>
</p>

<p>
Every <em>professional man and woman</em>, those dealing with social, medical, criminal,
legal, religious and educational matters will find this book of immediate value.
Nurses, police officials, heads of public institutions, writers, judges, clergymen
and teachers are urged to get this book at once.
</p>

<p>
The subject is treated from every point of view. The chapter on “love and other
irradiations of the sexual appetite” is a profound exposition of sex emotions—Contraceptive
means discussed—Degeneracy exposed—A guide to all in domestic
relations—A great book by a great man.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
